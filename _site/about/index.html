<p>Hi, I’m Eunice Chan!<br />
I’m an undergraduate as UC Berkeley with a double major in computer science and data science and a minor in digital humanities.</p>

<p>My focus is on learning new things and self-improvement so I know a little bit about a lot. My broad knowledge base allows me ability to pick things up quickly and relatively independently.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-learning">What I’m Learning</h2>
<p>My interests are computer science and data science (apparent from my majors), languages, the practice of art, and music.</p>

<h3 id="programming-cdds">Programming (CD&amp;DS)</h3>
<p>I enjoy making computer games, websites, and small applications, as well as data analysis and visualization.<br />
I’m currently reading up on algorithms and machine learning. I think machine learning is really cool, and have been learning a lot about it. I plan on eventually making a project with machine learning once I have less on my plate, so stay tuned!</p>

<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>I am studying Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, and Cantonese Chinese. I went to Japan over a summer to study Japanese in my sophomore year, but haven’t found the opportunity to practice it with another person since then. I couldn’t find any material to help me improve my Cantonese. Meanwhile, Mandarin is improving at a snail’s pace because it has a very low priority.</p>

<h3 id="art">Art</h3>
<p>My favorite media are digital, pencil, and watercolor, although I also enjoy sculpting with clay. I’ve also dabbled a bit in photography and video-editing.</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>I enjoy singing popular Vocaloid songs and songs from musicals. I also have basic guitar and piano skills.</p>

<h2 id="engagement">Engagement</h2>
<p>I’m working on improving myself. For me, that means being less passive in my life. One way I am working towards being less passive is to work on projects outside of class (like this website. Hi!) and to engage more in my everyday activities outside of just attending classes and doing homework. I would love to collaborate with you, so if you’re interested in working together, don’t hesitate to send me an <a href="mailto:ekchan@berkeley.edu">email</a>!</p>
